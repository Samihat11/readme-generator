## Installation

This app requires node.js. After node.js installation:

1. Clone the repo to you local device.
2. Run npm install.
3. Run node index.js

## Usage

All projects need a good README.md file to explain what their application does and how to use it. Having to write one for each program is cumbersome as it takes time to write. This app automates the writing of the file by prompting the user to answer a series of questions about the project. After answering all the questions, a readme file is generated for the user.
